Module 3: Data Warehouse

Overview

This repository contains my solutions for Module 3 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp. In this module, I explored data warehousing and analytics using Google BigQuery, covering data ingestion, external vs materialized tables, and dataset/schema management. I analyzed query performance using bytes processed and applied partitioning and clustering strategies to optimize query efficiency and reduce storage and compute costs.
Tech Stack

    Google Cloud Storage (GCS) — Cloud object storage for raw data
    Google BigQuery — Serverless data warehouse for analytics, partitioning, and clustering
